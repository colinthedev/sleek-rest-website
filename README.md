## Final Considerations :memo:

This project was great practice to strengthen positioning layout with responsive design.   
<br>
I used javascript for the catering/events section to display content based on selection and update with corresponding image depending on screen size. <br>
<br>
- By giving each image (mobile, tablet, desktop) an id, I could target them seperately and store them in their own variables, While depending on the screensize i disable and enable each image in media queries using CSS. The enabled ID ('desktopImage', 'tabletImage', 'mobileImage') then display's the correct corresponding image size.
<br>
Practice with form validation and displaying error messages using javascript.
